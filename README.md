# Milk Product Defect Probability Calculator

This program calculates the probability that a defective product was produced by each of three machines (Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C) in a milk product factory. The calculation is based on the probabilities of defective products produced by each machine, the overall probabilities of products produced by each machine, and the probabilities of each type of product (cheese, yogurt, butter) being produced by each machine.

## Usage
1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the probabilities as prompted for defective products produced by each machine, the overall probabilities of products produced by each machine, and the probabilities of cheese, yogurt, and butter being produced by each machine.
4. The program will calculate and display the probability that a defective product was produced by each machine, as well as the probabilities of cheese, yogurt, and butter being produced.

## Example

Suppose the factory has the following probabilities:
- Machine A produces 40% of the components, Machine B produces 30%, and Machine C produces the remaining 30%.
- The components produced by Machine A have a defect rate of 5%, those from Machine B have a defect rate of 7%, and those from Machine C have a defect rate of 10%.
- Machine A produces cheese 30% of the time, yogurt 50% of the time, and butter 20% of the time.
- Machine B produces cheese 25% of the time, yogurt 50% of the time, and butter 25% of the time.
- Machine C produces cheese 10% of the time, yogurt 40% of the time, and butter 50% of the time.

Entering these probabilities into the program, we get the following output:

Enter the probability of defective products produced by Machine A: 0.05
Enter the probability of defective products produced by Machine B: 0.07
Enter the probability of defective products produced by Machine C: 0.10
Enter the probability of products produced by Machine A: 0.40
Enter the probability of products produced by Machine B: 0.30
Enter the probability of products produced by Machine C: 0.30
Enter the probability of cheese being produced by Machine A: 0.30
Enter the probability of cheese being produced by Machine B: 0.25
Enter the probability of cheese being produced by Machine C: 0.10
Enter the probability of yogurt being produced by Machine A: 0.50
Enter the probability of yogurt being produced by Machine B: 0.50
Enter the probability of yogurt being produced by Machine C: 0.40
Enter the probability of butter being produced by Machine A: 0.20
Enter the probability of butter being produced by Machine B: 0.25
Enter the probability of butter being produced by Machine C: 0.50
