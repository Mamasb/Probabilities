# Milk Product Quality Control Probability Calculator

This program calculates the probability of a defective milk product being produced by each machine in a dairy factory given the defect rates and probabilities of milk product types.

## Explanation

The probability of a milk product being made from goat's milk and the probability of a milk product being cheese are essential for determining the probability that a defective milk product was produced by a specific machine.

Suppose a dairy factory produces milk products using three machines: Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C. Machine A produces 40% of the milk products, Machine B produces 30%, and Machine C produces the remaining 30%. The milk products produced by Machine A have a defect rate of 5%, those from Machine B have a defect rate of 7%, and those from Machine C have a defect rate of 10%.

## Usage

1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the probabilities of different milk product types being produced (e.g., cheese, yogurt, butter).
4. Enter the defect rates for each machine (Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C).
5. The program will calculate and display the probability that the defective milk product was produced by each machine.

## Example

Suppose the dairy factory produces three types of milk products: cheese, yogurt, and butter. The probabilities of each milk product type being produced are as follows: cheese (40%), yogurt (30%), and butter (30%). Additionally, the defect rates for each machine are: Machine A (5%), Machine B (7%), and Machine C (10%).

### Example Question

Suppose you randomly select a milk product from the factory and find it to be defective. You know that the probabilities of cheese, yogurt, and butter being produced are 40%, 30%, and 30%, respectively. Machine A has a defect rate of 5%, Machine B has a defect rate of 7%, and Machine C has a defect rate of 10%. What is the probability that the defective milk product was produced by Machine B?

Please enter the following probabilities and defect rates:
- Probability of cheese being produced: 0.40
- Probability of yogurt being produced: 0.30
- Probability of butter being produced: 0.30
- Defect rate for Machine A: 0.05
- Defect rate for Machine B: 0.07
- Defect rate for Machine C: 0.10
